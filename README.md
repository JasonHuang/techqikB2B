trying to make woocommerce B2C to B2B
1, Weight-based shipping class, normally, we don't wrap the products with boxes for wholesale, so the weight-based shipping class is needed.
2, Order Amount limit, if you want the customer to buy a minium amount of products for wholesale or maxmium amount to less the risk.
3, Cost based price management, for the wholesale, you may need update the price on the go, for example, for each product I want a 10 dollar profit, then you should fill in the cost for the products, and change the profit in the settings, and boom, the price are done. Somehow, now you want lower your profit, just change the setting in the plugin. 

For the above 3, still working on it.

if you have requirment, feel free to leave a message.
